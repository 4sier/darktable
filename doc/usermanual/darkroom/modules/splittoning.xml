							<entry>Original splittoning method creates a two color linear toning effect where the 
									shadows and highlights are represented by two different colors.
									In the example image below you can see an original black and white image and one where
									a splittoning effect are applied with blue in shadows and yellow-ish color in highlights.

		<para>darktable splittoning module has more parameters that impacts on the default above behavior, 
				we have balance which offsets the 50% gray level in image and compression that does compress
				toning in the shadows and highlights which  leaves a gap which are untouched by the effect.
				Read more and see examples of these additional parameters to splittoning module in "usage" section.
		</para>
		<para>The splittoning module does not convert image to black and white and works extensible nice on color images,
				soo if you want to do traditional splittoning, use the monochrome module to make the image black and white
				before playing around with splittoning effect.

		<sect4><title>Shadows and Highlights color</title>
			<para>These controls are used to set the color of the splittoning effect, you select the desire color and 
					saturation for both shadows and highlights, you can also click the color preview box too bring up a
					common color picker dialog.</para>
		</sect4>
		<sect4><title>Balance</title>
			<para>The balance is presented as an ratio bar and default value is 50/50 which means that 50% of lightness 
			range in image are used for shadows toning and the other 50% for highlights toning.
			</para>
		</sect4>
		<sect4><title>Compression</title>
			<para>Compression is a percentage of total lightness range that not is affected by color toning, default value is
				set to 33% which not is the default behaviour of a original splittoning which would be 0% compression.
				The choice of 33% as default is to invite you exprimenting with these parameters and how it extends the original 
				splittoning method...
