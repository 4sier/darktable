	<title>Overview</title>
	<para>Darktable is an application to manage and develop your digital images.</para>
	<para>It is fully non-destructive and works on a 32 bit floating point format per channel. 
			Most of the actions on the pixelpipe are done in CIELab.</para>

	<sect1 status="final"><title>Preferences</title>
		<para> A button located at the upper panel (displaying a wheel) allows you to define various parameters.
		</para>
		<para> The options are quite self-explaining. In case you need more information, just let your mouse hover text and/or entry box to display more information.

		<sect2 status="final"><title>Views</title>
			<para>Darktable consists of several views also mentioned as modes. For the time being, there are three available views as described 
				in this section. The current view is identified by the label at the top of the right panel.
				Some key accelerators, allowing to access the different views, are described in the table below:

			</para>
			<sect3 status="final"><title>Lighttable</title>
				<para>The lighttable view is where you manage your images and filmrolls; it's in that view that you rate, add tags, add colorlabels, export images among other
					actions.
				</para>

				<para>You can perform, on image under the mouse pointer, some actions using key accelerators; see "Lighttable" chapter.
				</para>

			</sect3>
			<sect3 status="final"><title>Darkroom</title>
				<para>In the darkroom view you develop a specific image using the available modules.
				</para>
			</sect3>
			<sect3 status="final"><title>Tethering</title>
				<para>This view is where you do camera tethering.
				</para>
			</sect3>

			<sect3 status="final"><title>Filmstrip</title>
				<para>The filmstrip shows the same images as lighttable with respect to filter and sort orders; it is turned on/off with key accelerator <emphasis>ctrl-f</emphasis>.
			  	You can navigate along the filmstrip by wheel scrolling.
				The filmstrip allows you to interact with images when you are not in lighttable mode. For example you can, while being in darkroom mode and developing an image, 
				switch to another image to develop by double clicking the thumb in the filmstrip. You can also rate the images as you do in lighttable, copy/paste historystack, etc.

	<sect1 status="final"><title>Darktable basic workflow</title>
		<sect2 status="draft"><title>Importing images</title>
			<para>To begin with Darktable, you first need to import images. You can either import
					from your filesystem or from your camera if supported.</para>
			<para>In the left panel you will find the import module, here you have the choice to import either a single image or a folder,
					Darktable will analyse its content, detect images that is already imported and only import new images.
			</para>
		</sect2>
				
		<sect2 status="draft"><title>Importing from camera</title>
			<sect3><title>Introduction</title>
				<para>Connect your camera to your system and if you distribution tries to automount it, select the option to abort the mount operation
					otherwise the camera will be locked and not accessible from within Darktable.</para>

				<para>In the left panel of lighttable view you have the import pane and if your don't see your camera there you need to hit the
					scan for devices button. Your camera will then appear in same pane with additional actions: import and tethering.</para>

		<sect2 status="draft"><title>Basic correction</title>
			<sect3><title>Introduction</title>
				<para>This section will guide you thru the basics about developing your image which includes most common changes to an image like
					noise reduction, temparature, exposure etc.
				</para>
				
				<para>To begin you need to open an image in Darkroom mode which you will do by double clicking an image thumbnail on the lighttable,
					it's in the darkroom mode you do the actual adjustments for an image and you have an arsenal of modules at your hand to help you 
					reach your goal.
				</para>
				
				<para>Each change you make on a module when developing your image is turned into a history stackitem, the history is stored in database
					and in an XMP sidecar file for the specific image.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					On the left panel in darkroom mode you have the history stack showing changes starting from bottom and building up with each change 
					you have made to the image, you can select a point in this history to show how the image looked in that point for comparisation of changes.
					The stack can be compressed and will discard changes during the development but will make it optimized, when you think you are done
					and have a good feeling of what you have done, just compress the history stack.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					Darktables ships with a bunch of modules and each of them is arranged into groups named modules groups, these module groups are accessed
					as toggle buttons in the right panel just under the histogram.
					There are also to special module groups named active and favorites, were active will show only modules enabled in history for the current image and
					favorites will only show modules selected as favorite by you, this is done in the "more plugins" at bottom of left panel, just click your favorite module
					until it gets an red tinted background and you have choosed your favorite.
				</para>
			</sect3>
			
			<sect3 status="draft"><title>Whitebalance</title>
				<para>This module controls the whitebalance of the image, its always enabled and reads its default
					values from metadata embedded in the image which will be set by your camera.
					The most common change here will be finetuning the whitebalance and this is done using the
					temperature in slider.
					Taking it down would make the color balance cooder and steering it up will make it warmer.
				</para>
			</sect3>
			
			<sect3 status="draft"><title>Exposure</title>
				<para>This might be the simplest plugin of them all, fine tune your exposure and use the histogram to guide you if you dont know what you are doing,
						you can also boost black level by increasing the black but be careful, use small amount like 0.005 steps.
						If you feel lucky use the auto correction feature, this might fail of several technical reasons...

		<sect2 status="draft"><title>Exporting images</title>
			<para>Images are exported from lighttable and is done using the export module in right panel, export means in general, save my developed RAW image as an jpeg.</para>
			<para>The export is also modularized into storage and format. Darktable is shipping several storage modules such as save on disk, picasa and flickr webalbum and more, 
				format modules is the actual image formats such as jpeg,png,tiff,openexr and more.
			</para>
			<para>Select images on your lighttable that you want to export, then choose your target storage and format to use and set the maximum width and height image size leave 
				them as zero if you want orginal resolution and hit the export button.
